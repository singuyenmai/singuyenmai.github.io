## Once upon a time

In 1963, meteorologist Edward Lorenz published a mathematical model for the dynamics of atmospheric convection. The equations are in very simplistic forms, but the resulting behaviour of the system is not. The way that its values change over time is enormously complex, obstructing attempts to predict its future state. Lorenz created the math, but he also discovered it. Following his work was the development of the important Chaos Theory, which covers concepts like Fractals, Predictibility, and Determinism. These names are more familiar to math specialists, but in the more general public, many probably have heard the term "*the Butterfly effect*" at some points in their lives. The Lorenz model is the mother of this concept.

## The butterfly

The Lorenz system comprises of three dynamic elements, or variables, notated as $X$ (rate of convection), $Y$ (horizontal temperature), and $Z$ (vertical temperature). The dynamics of these variables then are described by a set of equations called ordinary differential equations (ODE). These equations represent the rates of change of the variables, and they are as follows:

$$ 
\frac{dX}{dt} = \sigma (Y - X)
$$
$$
\frac{dY}{dt} = X (\rho - Z) - Y
$$
$$
\frac{dZ}{dt} = X Y - \beta Z
$$

I would not go into the details of the equations, nor why Lorenz designed them to be so, nor how to solve them. I assure you, we can completely move on without them. So let's now stick with this: $\sigma$, $\rho$, and $\beta$ are parameters - they are constant, and the solutions of these equations will be the functions describing how the system state, i.e. the variables, change through time - mathematically $X(t)$, $Y(t)$, and $Z(t)$.

To see the "butterfly", I added some specifications to the model and in solving the equations: <br>
1. $\sigma=10$, $\rho=28$, and $\beta=8/3$ <br>
2. The timepoints at which we would like to know the values of $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. Here, I let them 100,000 timepoints evenly spaced from 0 to 100. <br>
3. The initial condition, which is the system state at the initial timepoint. Here, it is a set of $X_{t=0} = 0.1, Y_{t=0}=0.0$, and $Z_{t=0}=0.0$.

Ready for the beauty?

**So, what is this "butterfly" made of?**

Technically, what you're seeing is a 2D plot of $X$ against $Z$ values. I just hid the coordinate axes. Also, while the butterfly appears to be only a single colorful string, this line is actually just a connection of 100,000 dots that sit very close together. 

Wait, but why 100,000 dots? Remember that I talked about the timepoints? These dots are different "states" of $X$ and $Z$ in time and their varying colors represent this.

Okay. But hey, there are three variables in the system. What it's like when we also have $Y$ there? 

Let's see it in 3D. This time, you can also interact with the graph. You can view the system entirely and inspect it from multiple angles. Try holding your pointer on the image, zooming in/out, and turning it around.

## Fractal

The beauty of the "butterfly" comes from the mix of warm and cold colors in both wings. Which insight can this mix of colors - the colors of time, give us into the behaviour of the system? Can you guess?

<!-- Sorry, it's such a long sentence. -->
Let's view the animation below, and follow the black dot that represents the system state.

<!-- {{< embed lorenz_system.ipynb#animation echo=false >}} -->

<p></p>

The dot moves around in the XYZ space, showing us how the system state changes as time passes.

Following this movement, you shall see that there is a pattern in it - something is repeated again and again. 

At first, the system state circles on the right wing, and when it gets near the center area of left wing, it goes rapidly towards it. <br>
However, once it lands on the left wing, it circles out and out - a movement that makes it gradually further away from the center of the left wing and closer to the right wing. <br>
Eventually, it gets so close to the center area of the right wing and then, goes straight back to it. <br>
Now this time, things are repeated. The system circles out away from the center of the right wing, until it gets close to and switches back to the left wing. <br>

This kind of pattern in the movement keeps repeating and seems like never-end. (It truly does!)

Also, if you inspect the interactive 3D plot carefully, you will notice that there is no region where the line crosses or merges back to itself. This tells us that although there is a repeated pattern, the system always takes new paths and never it goes back to an old state.

The illustration below is an example of a _fractal_ structure. Do you see the similiarities between it and the space-time path of the Lorenz system?

## Stability

Extreme contrast to _chaos_ is _stability_. But what is _stability_ then? 

An example of a _stable system_ is a population of organisms that follows logistic growth. 

In this model, the population at first grows exponentially, propbably because the resources are still abundant. However, since resources are limited, the population cannot grow to infinity but is restricted to a limit. 

Starting with a very few number of individuals, the population grows very fast in the beginning. But eventually, the growth slows down and then, reaches the limit.

Once the limit for population size is reached, the population experiences no more change and remains _stable_ there. There should be death but you would expect the death and birth rates are equivalent. 

The population level at its limit, therefore, is referred as a _stable state_, or _stable attractor_. Can you guess why it is called an _attractor_? (I'll leave you with the question :D)

## Chaos

There is also a feeling that there are some kinds of attractive forces at the centers of the two wings, which pull the system towards them when it approaches them. However, it's also look like that the system can only be attracted to some degree. Once it is on the area of the centers, it runs away from them. 

The "strange" dynamics described above is a typical example of _chaotic behaviours_.

<!-- In the language of the Mathematicians, _chaos_ is when a system never converges to any specific fixed state (aka _stable state_), but keeps changing over time and never goes back to a previous state.  -->

To see the chaos of the Lorenz system clearer, let's view separately the changes through time of each variable $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.

{{< embed lorenz_system.ipynb#xyz echo=false >}}

You can see, all the variables fluctuate wildly over time. They never stops changing and there is no certain periodic cycle in their dynamics. <br>
Is this behaviour also considered as "_chaotic_" to you?

## Sensitivity to initial conditions

## Predictibility




Considering one big assumption of the Lorenz model, we will see more of its beauty. 

First, what the model assumed is that there are certain fixed rules for the changes of atmospheric convection, which, are represented by the ODEs. This assumption is _determinism_. And in the Lorenz system, those rules are also very simple, However, to what we've seen, the system behaviour is extremely complex and the dynamics are "_chaotic_". So all of these tell us that, strangely yet beautifully, **chaos can come from determinism** and **complex dynamics/behaviours can come from just simple rules**.

Another way to interpret these is that when we observe and study the outside world, although some systems may appear to behave chaotically and their changes over time may seem so complex, there is still a possibility that such systems are actually determined by some fixed, and perhaps simple, rules. This brings lots more hope to our desire to understand the world ðŸ˜„. For me, this interpretation is also special because it is similar to the philosophy of the ancient **_I Ching_**, or **_The Book of Changes_**. 

## Determinism & Predictibility

As _chaotic_ systems do not converge to any fixed stable states, they are sensitive to initial conditions. 

Wait, what?

This means, if we change the initial conditions very very slightly, for instance by adding a super tiny variance to just one variable $X$ at time zero, then the dynamics will be changed as well.

<!-- Complex dynamics obstruct predictions. It is absolutely certain that if a system is _deterministic_ and defined by a constant set of rules, then we sure can predict its future once we know exactly two things: (1) the rules dictating and (2) the system's current or past states. However, even assuming that we already have the (1) condition, it's still practically impossible to have perfectly precise measurements for the (2) condition. And this, is a problem that comes with predictibilities of _chaotic_ systems. -->
