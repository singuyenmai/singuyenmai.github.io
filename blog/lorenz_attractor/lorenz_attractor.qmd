## Once upon a time

In 1963, meteorologist Edward Lorenz published a mathematical model for the dynamics of atmospheric convection. The equations are in very simplistic forms, but the resulting behaviour of the system is not. The way that its values change over time is enormously complex, making it impossible to predict its future state if no precise knowledge about its current state is available. Lorenz created the math, but at the same time, he also discovered it. The model has opened the door to and clarified various important concepts in math: Chaos, Fractals, Predictibility, and Determinism. These are more familiar to math specialists, but in the more general public, many probably have heard the term "*the butterfly effect*" at some point in their lives. The Lorenz model is also the mother of this concept.

## The butterfly

The Lorenz system comprises of three dynamic elements, or variables, notated as $X$ (rate of convection), $Y$ (horizontal temperature), and $Z$ (vertical temperature). The dynamics of these variables then are described by a set of equations called ordinary differential equations (ODE). These equations represent the rates of change of the variables, and they are as follows:

$$ 
\frac{dX}{dt} = \sigma (Y - X)
$$
$$
\frac{dY}{dt} = X (\rho - Z) - Y
$$
$$
\frac{dZ}{dt} = X Y - \beta Z
$$

I would not go into the details of the equations, nor why Lorenz designed them to be so, nor how to solve them. I assure you, we can completely move on without them. So let's now stick with this: $\sigma$, $\rho$, and $\beta$ are parameters - they are constant, and the solutions of these equations will be the functions describing how the system state, i.e. the variables, change through time - mathematically $X(t)$, $Y(t)$, and $Z(t)$.

To see the "*butterfly*", I added some specifications to the model and in solving the equations: <br>
1. $\sigma=10$, $\rho=28$, and $\beta=8/3$ <br>
2. The timepoints at which we would like to know the values of $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. Here, I let them 100,000 timepoints evenly spaced from 0 to 100. <br>
3. The initial condition, which is the system state at the initial timepoint. Here, it is a set of $X_{t=0} = 0.1, Y_{t=0}=0.0$, and $Z_{t=0}=0.0$.

Ready for the beauty?

**So, what is this "*butterfly*" made of?**

Technically, what you're seeing is a 2D plot of $X$ against $Z$ values. I just hid the coordinate axes. Also, while the butterfly appears to be just a single line, but actually, they are 100,000 dots that sit very close together there. If you are able to zoom in, you should see the space between them. Wait, but why 100,000 dots? Remember that I talked about the timepoints? These dots are different "states" of $X$ and $Z$ in time and their varying colors represent this.

Okay. But hey, there are three variables in the system, where is the $Y$? 

Sure, you shall be able to see it in 3D. This time, you can also interact with the graph. You can view the system entirely and, especially, inspect it from multiple angles. Try to hold your pointer on the image and turn it around!

Now pay more attention to the colors of the buterfly, the beauty comes from the mix of warm and cold colors in both wings. Does this mean anything?

The answer is: given that the color gradient represents the change in time and that the two wings indicate two main regions of system state, this colorful image tells us that as time goes, the system state switchs very frequently back and forth between those two regions. 

Sorry, it's such a long sentence. Let's play the animation below and follow the movement of the black dot, which indicates the system state.

<br>
Following the change of the system state through time, we can see that the pattern of change seems to repeat itself. 

At first, the system state circles towards the right wing, yet once it lands on this wing, it circles out. <br>
The circling goes on for a while until suddenly, the system switches back to the left wing, <br>
which then, again, circles out until it moves back to the right wing. <br>

This pattern keeps repeating and can go on infinitely! 

If you look very carefully, you will notice that although the pattern is replicated, the system always takes new paths and never it goes back to an old state. Geometrically, this structure is considered as a _fractal_. (So now you know what the mathematicians are talking about? :D)

## Chaos & Determinism

The "strange" dynamics described above is a typical example of _chaotic behaviors_.

In the language of the Mathematicians, _chaos_ is when a system never converges to any specific fixed state (aka _stable state_), but keeps changing over time and never goes back to a previous state. _"No man ever steps in the same river twice."_

To see the chaos of the Lorenz system clearer, let's view separately the changes through time of each variable $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.

{{< embed lorenz_system.ipynb#xyz echo=false >}}

You can see, all the variables fluctuate wildly over time. They do not converge to any stable state, nor there is a certain periodic cycle in their dynamics. Is this also considered as "_chaotic_" to you?

On the contrary, an example of a _stable system_ is a population of organisms that follows logistic growth. In this case, the population at first grows exponentially, propbably because the resources are still abundant. However, since resources are limited, the population cannot grow to infinity but is restricted to a limit. Once the population size reaches this limit, the population experiences no more change and remains _stable_ there. (There should be death but you would expect the death and birth rates are equivalent). The population level at its limit, therefore, is referred as a _stable state_, or _stable attractor_ (it's like the population is attracted to grow towards it).

**What can be more odd about the Lorenz system?**

Considering one big assumption of the Lorenz model, we will see more of its beauty. 

First, what the model assumed is that there are certain fixed rules for the changes of atmospheric convection, which, are represented by the ODEs. This assumption is _determinism_. And in the Lorenz system, those rules are also very simple, However, to what we've seen, the system behaviour is extremely complex and the dynamics are "_chaotic_". So all of these tell us that, strangely yet beautifully, **chaos can come from determinism** and **complex dynamics/behaviours can come from just simple rules**.

Another way to interpret these is that when we observe and study the outside world, although some systems may appear to behave chaotically and their changes over time may seem so complex, there is still a possibility that such systems are actually determined by some fixed, and perhaps simple, rules. This brings lots more hope to our desire to understand the world ðŸ˜„. For me, this interpretation is also special because it is similar to the philosophy of the ancient **_I Ching_**, or **_The Book of Changes_**. 

## Determinism & Predictibility

As _chaotic_ systems do not converge to any fixed stable states, they are sensitive to initial conditions. 

Wait, what?

This means, if we change the initial conditions very very slightly, for instance by adding a super tiny variance to just one variable $X$ at time zero, then the dynamics will be changed as well.

<!-- Complex dynamics obstruct predictions. It is absolutely certain that if a system is _deterministic_ and defined by a constant set of rules, then we sure can predict its future once we know exactly two things: (1) the rules dictating and (2) the system's current or past states. However, even assuming that we already have the (1) condition, it's still practically impossible to have perfectly precise measurements for the (2) condition. And this, is a problem that comes with predictibilities of _chaotic_ systems. -->
