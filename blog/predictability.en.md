## Sensitivity to initial conditions

## Predictibility


## Determinism & Predictibility

As _chaotic_ systems do not converge to any fixed stable states, they are sensitive to initial conditions. 

Wait, what?

This means, if we change the initial conditions very very slightly, for instance by adding a super tiny variance to just one variable $X$ at time zero, then the dynamics will be changed as well.

<!-- Complex dynamics obstruct predictions. It is absolutely certain that if a system is _deterministic_ and defined by a constant set of rules, then we sure can predict its future once we know exactly two things: (1) the rules dictating and (2) the system's current or past states. However, even assuming that we already have the (1) condition, it's still practically impossible to have perfectly precise measurements for the (2) condition. And this, is a problem that comes with predictibilities of _chaotic_ systems. -->
