    "text": "I grew up in the bustle Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon or as the ‚ÄúPearl of the Far East‚Äù. This is also where I studied my Bachelor in Biomedical Engineering at the International University IU-VNU-HCMC, from 2014 to 2019. In the Fall of 2020, I moved to the Netherlands to start my Master‚Äôs in Ecology & Evolution at the University of Groningen. After around 1.5 years, I then stayed in London, UK for 5 months for my final research project and then completed my study in the Summer of 2022. Now, I‚Äôm working as a Research Assistant at the Molecular Epidemiology Group at OUCRU Vietnam.\nMy scientific interests are broad and dynamic, but over the past few years and probably more to come, I have just been sticking to the world of microbes, ecology, evolution, and health. I‚Äôm also specifically attracted to complex systems with inter-dependent relationships and emergent behaviours, such as host-microbiome systems. Along with these topics, I enjoy coding and working with data. My enthusiasm for modeling only started very recently, in the beginning of my Master‚Äôs. Yet, it has grown so strong that although I now don‚Äôt use it in my current work, I‚Äôm still continuing my learning. Last but not least, I love sharing what I‚Äôve learned to other people and, therefore, writing the blog posts here."
