    "text": "Once upon a time\nIn 1963, meteorologist Edward Lorenz published a mathematical model for the dynamics of atmospheric convection. The equations are in very simplistic forms, but the resulting behaviour of the system is not. The way that its values change over time is enormously complex, obstructing attempts to predict its future state. Lorenz created the math, but he also discovered it. Following his work was the development of the important Chaos Theory, which covers concepts like Fractals, Predictibility, and Determinism. These names are more familiar to math specialists, but in the more general public, many probably have heard the term ‚Äúthe Butterfly effect‚Äù at some points in their lives. The Lorenz model is the mother of this concept.\n\n\nThe butterfly\nThe Lorenz system comprises of three dynamic elements, or variables, notated as \\(X\\) (rate of convection), \\(Y\\) (horizontal temperature), and \\(Z\\) (vertical temperature). The dynamics of these variables then are described by a set of equations called ordinary differential equations (ODE). These equations represent the rates of change of the variables, and they are as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = \\sigma (Y - X)\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = X (\\rho - Z) - Y\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{dZ}{dt} = X Y - \\beta Z\n\\]\nI would not go into the details of the equations, nor why Lorenz designed them to be so, nor how to solve them. I assure you, we can completely move on without them. So let‚Äôs now stick with this: \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(\\beta\\) are parameters - they are constant, and the solutions of these equations will be the functions describing how the system state, i.e.¬†the variables, change through time - mathematically \\(X(t)\\), \\(Y(t)\\), and \\(Z(t)\\).\nTo see the ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù, I added some specifications to the model and in solving the equations:\n\n\\(\\sigma=10\\), \\(\\rho=28\\), and \\(\\beta=8/3\\) \nThe timepoints at which we would like to know the values of \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\). Here, I let them 100,000 timepoints evenly spaced from 0 to 100. \nThe initial condition, which is the system state at the initial timepoint. Here, it is a set of \\(X_{t=0} = 0.1, Y_{t=0}=0.0\\), and \\(Z_{t=0}=0.0\\).\n\nReady for the beauty?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶ Well, it‚Äôs already here.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is this ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù made of?\nTechnically, what you‚Äôre seeing is a 2D plot of \\(X\\) against \\(Z\\) values. I just hid the coordinate axes. Also, while the butterfly appears to be only a single colorful string, this line is actually just a connection of 100,000 dots that sit very close together.\nWait, but why 100,000 dots? Remember that I talked about the timepoints? These dots are different ‚Äústates‚Äù of \\(X\\) and \\(Z\\) in time and their varying colors represent this.\nOkay. But hey, there are three variables in the system. What it‚Äôs like when we also have \\(Y\\) there?\nLet‚Äôs see it in 3D. This time, you can also interact with the graph. You can view the system entirely and inspect it from multiple angles. Try holding your pointer on the image, zooming in/out, and turning it around.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack dot is the system state at time zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nFractal\nThe beauty of the ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù comes from the mix of warm and cold colors in both wings. Which insight can this mix of colors - the colors of time, give us into the behaviour of the system? Can you guess?\nLet‚Äôs view the animation below, and follow the black dot that represents the system state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dot moves around in the XYZ space, showing us how the system state changes as time passes.\nFollowing this movement, you shall see that there is a pattern in it - something is repeated again and again.\nAt first, the system state circles on the right wing, and when it gets near the center area of left wing, it goes rapidly towards it.  However, once it lands on the left wing, it circles out and out - a movement that makes it gradually further away from the center of the left wing and closer to the right wing.  Eventually, it gets so close to the center area of the right wing and then, goes straight back to it.  Now this time, things are repeated. The system circles out away from the center of the right wing, until it gets close to and switches back to the left wing. \nThis kind of pattern in the movement keeps repeating and seems like never-end. (It truly does!)\nAlso, if you inspect the interactive 3D plot carefully, you will notice that there is no region where the line crosses or merges back to itself. This tells us that although there is a repeated pattern, the system always takes new paths and never it goes back to an old state.\n\n‚ÄúNo man ever steps in the same river twice.‚Äù\n\nThe illustration below is an example of a fractal structure. Do you see the similiarities between it and the space-time path of the Lorenz system?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStability\n\nBefore going further with all the weirdness of the Lorenz system, I would like to offer you a little short break - a system with a much simpler behaviour.\nWe will now look at a model for the growth of a population of organisms.\nIn this model, the population at first grows exponentially, propbably because the resources are still abundant. However, since resources are limited, the population cannot grow to infinity but is restricted to a limit.\nStarting with a very few number of individuals, the population grows very fast in the beginning. But eventually, the growth slows down and then, reaches the limit.\nOnce the limit for population size is reached, the population experiences no more change and remains stable there. There should be death but you would expect the death and birth rates are equivalent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis limit of population level is referred as a stable state.\nIt is also called the stable attractor. Because it also looks like the system (population size) runs towards this level through time and when it reaches there, it sticks there. If we start the population from a variety of initial sizes, we will see that it will always eventually end up at the stable state, like it is attracted to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChaos\nNow looking at the Lorenz system again, there is also a feeling that there are some kinds of attractive forces at the centers of the two wings, which pull the system towards them when it approaches them.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it seems that the system can only be attracted to some degree. Once the system lands on one of the center area, it immediately runs away.\nThe centers of the wings are strange attractors. They attract the system, but when it gets too close, they repulse it. These two strange attractors result in the chaotic behaviour of the system, making it move back and forth between them and is always pushed and pulled to different paths.\nThe chaos of the Lorenz system can be more apparent clearer when we view separately the changes through time of each variable \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, all the variables fluctuate wildly over time. They never stops changing and there is no repeated cycle. The only repeated thing, or pattern, that we can find is that they fluctuate, and that‚Äôs it.\nSo that, is chaos.\n\n\nChaos and Determinism\nConsidering one big assumption of the Lorenz model, we will see more of its beauty.\nFirst, what the model assumed is that there are certain fixed rules for the changes of atmospheric convection, which, are represented by the ODEs. This assumption is determinism. And in the Lorenz system, those rules are also very simple, However, to what we‚Äôve seen, the system behaviour is extremely complex and the dynamics are ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù. So all of these tell us that, strangely yet beautifully, chaos can come from determinism and complex changes can come from just simple rules.\nThere is another way to interpret this. That is when we observe and study the outside world, although some systems may appear to behave chaotically and their changes over time may seem so complex, there is still a possibility that such systems are actually determined by some fixed, and perhaps simple, rules.\nIn my perspective, this interpretation aligns with a core philosophy of the ancient I Ching, or The Book of Changes. That is: the world changes, but there should be rules, and the rules are constant.\n\n\nReferences\nI‚Äôve learned to demonstrate (computationally) the Lorenz system from the following work:\n\nhttps://geoffboeing.com/2016/12/animating-lorenz-attractor-python/\nhttps://fromsystosys.netlify.app/2018/07/28/lorenz-attractor-animation-plotly/\n\nOther pieces of introductory articles about strange attractors, the Butterfly effect, and fractals\n\nhttps://fractalfoundation.org/OFC/OFC-7-1.html/\nhttps://hypertextbook.com/chaos/strange/"
