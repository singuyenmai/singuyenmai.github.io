Si Nguyen (Sƒ© Nguy√™n) is my first name, but you could call me either by this or just Nguyen or Si. Nguyen is the ‚Äúfirst among equals‚Äù name, and Si is a nickname my friends have for me. I am, therefore, happy to be called by all of these three ways.\nI grew up in the bustle Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon or as the ‚ÄúPearl of the Far East‚Äù. This is also where I studied my Bachelor in Biomedical Engineering at the International University IU - VNU HCMC, where my scientific career"
