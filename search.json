    "text": "I am Si-Nguyen Mai. I‚Äôm from Vietnam in the Far East. My original full name is Mai Thu Sƒ© Nguy√™n. Si Nguyen (Sƒ© Nguy√™n) is my first name, but you could call me either by this or just Nguyen or Si. Nguyen is the ‚Äúfirst among equals‚Äù name, and Si is a nickname my friends have for me. I am, therefore, happy to be called by all of these three ways.\nI grew up in the bustle Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon or as the ‚ÄúPearl of the Far East‚Äù. This is also where I studied my Bachelor in Biomedical Engineering at the International University IU-VNU-HCMC, from 2014 to 2019, and where I took my first steps in scientific research. The first research group I joined was the Biomolecular Engineering group at the university. There, I studied the growth of mammalian cells on engineered proteins and I was also familiarized with managing a Cell Culture Laboratory. However, as my interest for programming and data analysis has grown a lot later on, I decided to change my path to the Bioinformatics area. So my Bachelor‚Äôs thesis was on cancer epigenomics, studied through analyzing epigenomic and transcriptomic data. And for my internship, I did a project in bacterial evolutionary genomics at OUCRU Vietnam. It was since this internship, that I became very attracted to evolution and the microbial world.\nFollowing my interests, in 2020, I enrolled in the Master‚Äôs programme in Ecology & Evolution at the University of Groningen. Right from the early days, my classes were enriched with theoretical research and mathematical/computational modeling, and I, was immediately **enchanted* by their beauty. My interest in microbes was also nurtured. Most of my time then was spent for questions in ecology and evolution of microbial communities. My first research project was on the impact of metabolic flexibility on diversity and stability of microbial communities, while the second one was on controlling the infectious communities with reinforcement learning. Certainly, there were mathematical models in both of these projects, and they were from both top-down (with general Lotka-Volterra model) and bottom-up (with genome-scaled metabolic models) approaches. My modeling toolbox was also a little bit extended through the Biological Modeling courses, in which I was introduced to a variety of modeling approaches, such as stochastic and agent-based modeling. All of these have been the source of motivation for my blog posts here."
