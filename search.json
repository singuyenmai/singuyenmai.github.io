    "section": "The butterfly",
    "text": "The butterfly\nThe Lorenz system comprises of three dynamic elements, or variables, notated as \\(X\\) (rate of convection), \\(Y\\) (horizontal temperature), and \\(Z\\) (vertical temperature). The dynamics of these variables then are described by a set of equations called ordinary differential equations (ODE). These equations represent the rates of change of the variables, and they are as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = \\sigma (Y - X)\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = X (\\rho - Z) - Y\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{dZ}{dt} = X Y - \\beta Z\n\\]\nI would not go into the details of the equations, nor why Lorenz designed them to be so, nor how to solve them. I assure you, we can completely move on without them. So let‚Äôs now stick with this: \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(\\beta\\) are parameters - they are constant, and the solutions of these equations will be the functions describing how the system state, i.e.¬†the variables, change through time - mathematically \\(X(t)\\), \\(Y(t)\\), and \\(Z(t)\\).\nTo see the ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù, I added some specifications to the model and in solving the equations: 1. \\(\\sigma=10\\), \\(\\rho=28\\), and \\(\\beta=8/3\\) 2. The timepoints at which we would like to know the values of \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\). Here, I let them 100,000 timepoints evenly spaced from 0 to 100. 4. The initial condition, which is the system state at the initial timepoint. Here, it is a set of \\(X_{t=0} = 0.1, Y_{t=0}=0.0, Z_{t=0}=0.0\\).\nReady for the beauty?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶ Well, it‚Äôs already here.\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is this ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù made of?\nTechnically, what you‚Äôre seeing is a 2D plot of \\(X\\) against \\(Z\\) values. I just hid the coordinate axes. Also, while the butterfly appears to be just a single line, but actually, they are 100,000 dots that sit very close together there. If you are able to zoom in, you should see the space between them. Wait, but why 100,000 dots? Remember that I talked about the timepoints? These dots are different ‚Äústates‚Äù of \\(X\\) and \\(Z\\) in time and their varying colors represent this.\nOkay. But hey, there are three variables in the system, where is the \\(Y\\)?\nSure, you shall be able to see it in 3D. This time, you can also interact with the plot. You can view the system entirely and, especially, inspect it from multiple angles. My visualiztion tricks won‚Äôt be hidden anymore ;) Try to hold your pointer on the image and turn it around!\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nNow pay more attention to the colors of the buterfly, the beauty comes from the mix of warm and cold colors in both wings. Does this mean anything?\nThe answer is: given that the color gradient represents the change in time and that the two wings indicate two main regions of system state, this colorful image tells us that as time goes, the system state switchs very frequently back and forth between those two regions.\nBlah blah blah, it‚Äôs such a long sentence. Let‚Äôs play the animation below and follow the movement of the black dot, which indicates the system state.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n Following the change of the system state through time, we can see that the pattern of change seems to repeat itself.\nAt first, the system state circles towards the right wing, yet once it lands on this wing, it circles out.  The circling goes on for a while until suddenly, the system switches back to the left wing, which then, again, circles out until it moves back to the right wing.  This pattern keeps repeating and can go on infinitely!\nIf you look very carefully, you will notice that although the pattern is replicated, the system always takes new paths and never it goes back to an old state. Geometrically, this structure is considered as a fractal. (So now you know what the mathematicians are talking about? :D)"

    "section": "Chaos & Determinism",
    "text": "Chaos & Determinism\nThe ‚Äústrange‚Äù dynamics described above is a typical example of chaotic behaviors.\n(I‚Äôll try to make this straight) The system is chaotic because it never converges to any specific fixed state (aka stable state), but keeps changing over time and the cyles are never exactly the same. To see the chaos of the Lorenz system clearer, let‚Äôs view separately the changes through time of each variable \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see, all the variables fluctuate wildly over time. They do not converge to any stable state, nor there is a no certain periodic cycle in their dynamics. This, is chaos!\nOn the contrary, an example of a stable system is a population of organisms that follows logistic growth. In this case, the population at first grows exponentially, propbably because the resources are still abundant. However, since resources are limited, the population cannot grow to infinity but is restricted to a limit. Once the population size reaches this limit, the population experiences no more change and remains stable there. (There should be death but you would expect the death and birth rates are equivalent). The population level at its limit, therefore, is referred as a stable state, or stable attractor (it‚Äôs like the population is attracted to grow towards it).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can be more odd about the Lorenz system?\nConsidering one big assumption of the Lorenz model, we may start feel a bit strange about the chaotic behaviors we‚Äôve seen.\nFirst, what the model assumed is that there are certain fixed rules for the changes of atmospheric convection, which, are represented by the ODEs. This assumption is determinism. And in the Lorenz system, those rules are also very simple, However, to what we‚Äôve seen, the system behaviour is extremely complex and the dynamics are chaotic. So all of these tell us that, strangely yet beautifully, chaos can come from determinism and complex dynamics/behaviours can come from just simple rules.\nAnother way to interpret these is that when we observe and study the outside world, although some systems may appear to behave chaotically and their changes over time may seem so complex, there is still a possibility that such systems are actually determined by some fixed, and perhaps simple, rules. This brings lots more hope to our desire to understand the world üòÑ. For me, this interpretation is also special because it is similar to the philosophy of the ancient I Ching, or The Book of Changes."

Let‚Äôs take a look at the resulting dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶ work in progress ‚Ä¶"
