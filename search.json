    "text": "In 2020, I enrolled in the Master’s programme in Ecology & Evolution at the University of Groningen. Right from the early days, my classes were enriched with theoretical studies and mathematical/computational models, and I, was immediately enchanted by their beauty. So I decided to dedicate my Master’s to learn and practice the science, and art of biological modeling. Today, I still don’t regret about my decision, and I think I never will.\nTheoretical models always intrigue me. There are lots of interesting things can be derived from them. And I would say: Don’t let the maths or the codes scare you! There are lots of brilliant theoretical works that came from just very simple models. Mastering math and coding is certainly needed to go deeper, but also, limited knowledge in these subjects should not prevent anyone from enjoying the science.\nIn this blog post, I would like to"

    "text": "Hi 👋, I am Si-Nguyen Mai. I’m from Vietnam in the Far East. My original full name is Mai Thu Sĩ Nguyên. Si Nguyen (Sĩ Nguyên) is my first name, but you could call me either by this or just Nguyen or Si. Nguyen is the “first among equals” name, and Si is a nickname my friends have for me. I am, therefore, happy to be called by all of these three ways.\nI’m living in the bustle Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon or as the “Pearl of the Far East”. This is also where I studied my BEng in Biomedical Engineering at the International University IU-VNU-HCMC, from 2014 to 2019. In the Fall of 2020, I moved to the Netherlands to start my MSc in Ecology & Evolution at the University of Groningen. After around 1.5 years, I then stayed in the UK for 5 months for my final research project and then completed my study in the Summer of 2022. Now, I’m looking for a new opportunity to contribute, and to learn and grow myself. \nMy scientific interests are broad and dynamic, but over the past few years and probably more to come, I have just been sticking to the world of microbes, ecology, evolution, and health. I’m also specifically attracted to complex systems with inter-dependent relationships and emergent behaviours, such as host-microbiome systems. Along with these topics, I enjoy coding and working with data. My enthusiasm for modeling only started very recently, in the beginning of my Master’s. Yet, it has grown so strong that although my time at university has ended, I’m still continuing my learning. Last but not least, I love sharing what I’ve learned to other people and, therefore, writing the blog posts here."
