    "text": "The butterfly\nThe Lorenz system comprises of three dynamic elements, or variables, notated as \\(X\\) (rate of convection), \\(Y\\) (horizontal temperature), and \\(Z\\) (vertical temperature). The dynamics of these variables then are described by a set of equations called ordinary differential equations (ODE). These equations represent the rates of change of the variables, and they are as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = \\sigma (Y - X)\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = X (\\rho - Z) - Y\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{dZ}{dt} = X Y - \\beta Z\n\\]\nI would not go into the details of the equations, nor why Lorenz designed them to be so, nor how to solve them. I assure you, we can completely move on without them. So let‚Äôs now stick with this: \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(\\beta\\) are parameters - they are constant, and the solutions of these equations will be the functions describing how the system state, i.e.¬†the variables, change through time - mathematically \\(X(t)\\), \\(Y(t)\\), and \\(Z(t)\\).\nTo see the ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù, I added some specifications to the model and in solving the equations:  1. \\(\\sigma=10\\), \\(\\rho=28\\), and \\(\\beta=8/3\\)  2. The timepoints at which we would like to know the values of \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\). Here, I let them 100,000 timepoints evenly spaced from 0 to 100.  3. The initial condition, which is the system state at the initial timepoint. Here, it is a set of \\(X_{t=0} = 0.1, Y_{t=0}=0.0\\), and \\(Z_{t=0}=0.0\\).\nReady for the beauty?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶ Well, it‚Äôs already here.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is this ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù made of?\nTechnically, what you‚Äôre seeing is a 2D plot of \\(X\\) against \\(Z\\) values. I just hid the coordinate axes. Also, while the butterfly appears to be just a single line, but actually, they are 100,000 dots that sit very close together there. If you are able to zoom in, you should see the space between them. Wait, but why 100,000 dots? Remember that I talked about the timepoints? These dots are different ‚Äústates‚Äù of \\(X\\) and \\(Z\\) in time and their varying colors represent this.\nOkay. But hey, there are three variables in the system. What it‚Äôs like when we also have \\(Y\\) there?\nLet‚Äôs see it in 3D. This time, you can also interact with the graph. You can view the system entirely and inspect it from multiple angles. Try holding your pointer on the image, zooming in/out, and turning it around.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack dot is the system state at time zero."

    "text": "Fractals\nThe beauty of the butterfly comes from the mix of warm and cold colors in both wings. Can this mix of colors - the colors of time, mean anything? Can you guess?\n\n\nLet‚Äôs view the animation below, and follow the black dot that represents the system state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dot moves around in the XYZ space, showing us how the system state changes as time passes.\nFollowing this movement, you shall see that there is a pattern in it - something was repeated again and again.\nAt first, the system state circles towards the right wing, yet once it lands on this wing, it circles out.  The circling goes on for a while until suddenly, the system switches back to the left wing,  which then, again, circles out until it moves back to the right wing. \nThis pattern keeps repeating and can go on infinitely!\nIf you look very carefully, you will notice that although there is a repeated pattern, the system always takes new paths and never it goes back to an old state. Geometrically, this structure is considered as a fractal. (So now you know what the mathematicians are talking about? :D)"

    "text": "Chaos\nThe ‚Äústrange‚Äù dynamics described above is a typical example of chaotic behaviours.\nIn the language of the Mathematicians, chaos is when a system never converges to any specific fixed state (aka stable state), but keeps changing over time and never goes back to a previous state. ‚ÄúNo man ever steps in the same river twice.‚Äù\nTo see the chaos of the Lorenz system clearer, let‚Äôs view separately the changes through time of each variable \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see, all the variables fluctuate wildly over time. They never stops changing and there is no certain periodic cycle in their dynamics.  Is this behaviour also considered as ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù to you?"

    "section": "Stability",
    "text": "Stability\nExtreme contrast to chaos is stability. But what is stability then?\nAn example of a stable system is a population of organisms that follows logistic growth.\nIn this model, the population at first grows exponentially, propbably because the resources are still abundant. However, since resources are limited, the population cannot grow to infinity but is restricted to a limit.\nStarting with a very few number of individuals, the population grows very fast in the beginning. But eventually, the growth slows down and then, reaches the limit.\nOnce the limit for population size is reached, the population experiences no more change and remains stable there. There should be death but you would expect the death and birth rates are equivalent.\nThe population level at its limit, therefore, is referred as a stable state, or stable attractor. Can you guess why it is called an attractor? (I‚Äôll leave you with the question :D)"

    "text": "Chaotic, but Deterministic\nConsidering one big assumption of the Lorenz model, we will see more of its beauty.\nFirst, what the model assumed is that there are certain fixed rules for the changes of atmospheric convection, which, are represented by the ODEs. This assumption is determinism. And in the Lorenz system, those rules are also very simple, However, to what we‚Äôve seen, the system behaviour is extremely complex and the dynamics are ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù. So all of these tell us that, strangely yet beautifully, chaos can come from determinism and complex dynamics/behaviours can come from just simple rules.\nAnother way to interpret these is that when we observe and study the outside world, although some systems may appear to behave chaotically and their changes over time may seem so complex, there is still a possibility that such systems are actually determined by some fixed, and perhaps simple, rules. This brings lots more hope to our desire to understand the world üòÑ. For me, this interpretation is also special because it is similar to the philosophy of the ancient I Ching, or The Book of Changes."
