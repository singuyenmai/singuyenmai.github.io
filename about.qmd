<!-- Thanks for your interest in getting to know more about me. :) -->

Hi üëã, I am **_Si-Nguyen Mai_**. I'm from Vietnam in the Far East. My original full name is **_Mai Thu Sƒ© Nguy√™n_**. **_Si Nguyen_** (_Sƒ© Nguy√™n_) is my first name, but you could call me either by this or just **_Nguyen_** or **_Si_**. **_Nguyen_** is the "_first among equals_" name, and **_Si_** is a nickname my friends have for me. I am, therefore, happy to be called by all of these three ways.

I'm living in the bustle Ho Chi Minh City, also known as _Saigon_ or as the "_Pearl of the Far East_‚Äù. <!-- This is also where I studied my **BEng in Biomedical Engineering** at the International University IU-VNU-HCMC, from 2014 to 2019. In the Fall of 2020, I moved to the Netherlands to start my **MSc in Ecology & Evolution** at the University of Groningen. After around 1.5 years, I then stayed in the UK for 5 months for my final research project and then completed my study in the Summer of 2022. Now, I'm looking for a new opportunity to contribute, and to learn and grow myself. -->
Here, I'm working as a **Research Assistant** at the Molecular Epidemiology Group at OUCRU Vietnam. The city is also where I studied my **BEng in Biomedical Engineering** at the International University IU-VNU-HCMC, from 2014 to 2019. In this Summer of 2022, I got my **MSc degree in Ecology & Evolution** at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, after 2 years of studying. For my Master's, I stayed in the Netherlands for around 1.5 years and then in the UK for 5 months for a short research project.

My scientific interests are broad and dynamic, but over the past few years and probably more to come, I have just been sticking to the world of **microbes**, **ecology**, **evolution**, and **health**. I'm also specifically attracted to **complex systems** with inter-dependent relationships and emergent behaviours, such as host-microbiome systems. Along with these topics, I enjoy **coding** and working with **data**. My enthusiasm for **modeling** only started very recently, in the beginning of my Master's. Yet, it has grown so strong that although my time at university has ended, I'm still continuing my learning. Last but not least, I love **sharing** what I've learned to other people and, therefore, **writing** the blog posts here. 

<!-- I grew up in the bustle Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon or as the *‚ÄúPearl of the Far East‚Äù*. This is also where I studied my Bachelor in Biomedical Engineering at the International University IU-VNU-HCMC, from 2014 to 2019, and where I took my first steps in scientific research. 

The first research group I joined was the Biomolecular Engineering group at the university. There, I studied the growth of mammalian cells on engineered proteins and I was also familiarized with managing a Cell Culture Laboratory. However, as my interest for programming and data analysis has grown a lot later on, I decided to change my path to the Bioinformatics area. So my Bachelor's thesis was on cancer epigenomics, studied through analyzing epigenomic and transcriptomic data. And for my internship, I did a project in bacterial evolutionary genomics at OUCRU Vietnam. It was since this internship, that I became very attracted to evolution and the microbial world. 

Following my interests, in 2020, I enrolled in the Master's programme in Ecology & Evolution at the University of Groningen. Right from the early days, my classes were enriched with theoretical research and mathematical/computational modeling, and I, was immediately *enchanted* by their beauty. 

My interest in microbes was also nurtured. Most of my time then was spent for questions in ecology and evolution of microbial communities. My first research project was on the impact of metabolic flexibility on diversity and stability of microbial communities, while the second one was on controlling the infectious communities with reinforcement learning. 

Certainly, there were mathematical models in both of these projects, and they were from both top-down (with general Lotka-Volterra model) and bottom-up (with genome-scaled metabolic models) approaches. My modeling toolbox was also a little bit extended through the Biological Modeling courses, in which I was introduced to a variety of modeling approaches, such as stochastic and agent-based modeling. All of these have been the source of inspiration for my blog posts here. -->
