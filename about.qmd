Hi 👋, I am **_Si-Nguyen Mai_**. My original full name is **_Mai Thu Sĩ Nguyên_**. I'm from Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam, which is also known as _Saigon_, or "_Pearl of the Far East_”. 

My work is primarily in *Science*. But my interests are broad -- I also enjoy *Art* and I'm intrigued by *Philosophy* and *Religion*.

I put my knowledge and my reflections on them in the Blogs. They will be messy, but I will try to make them more organized. Hope you would enjoy!
