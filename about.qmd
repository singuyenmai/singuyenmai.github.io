Hi üëã, I am **_Si-Nguyen Mai_**. My original full name is **_Mai Thu Sƒ© Nguy√™n_**. I'm from Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam, which is also known as _Saigon_, or the "_Pearl of the Far East_‚Äù. 

So far, my intellectual path has crossed here and there. I got my BEng degree in Biomedical Engineering in Ho Chi Minh City, and then my MSc in Ecology & Evolution in Groningen, the Netherlands. During my Master's, I also spent a few months in the UK for a research project. Now, I'm back in my hometown again, continuing my enthusiasm for science, especially science about microbes.

My current position is a Research Assistant at the Molecular Epidemiology Group at OUCRU Vietnam. In my work, I spend my time to understand *Klebsiella pneumoniae* - a critical disease-causing and multidrug-resistant bacteria, by studying their behaviours in the lab and characterizing their genomes from DNA sequencing data.

My scientific interests are broad and dynamic, but over the past few years, and probably more to come, I have found myself in the world of **microbes**, **ecology**, **evolution**, and **the science of health**. I'm also immensely attracted to **complex systems** with inter-dependent relationships and emergent behaviours, such as host-microbiome systems. During my research, I enjoy **programming**, building **mathematical/computational models**, and analysing **data**.
