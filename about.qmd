Hi üëã, I am **_Si-Nguyen Mai_**. My original full name is **_Mai Thu Sƒ© Nguy√™n_**. I'm from Vietnam in the Far East. 
I was born in the bustle Ho Chi Minh City, which is also known as _Saigon_, or the "_Pearl of the Far East_‚Äù. 

So far, my intellectual path has crossed here and there. I got my BEng degree in Biomedical Engineering in Ho Chi Minh City, and then my MSc in Ecology & Evolution in Groningen, the Netherlands. During my Master's, I also spent a few months in the UK for a research project. Now, I'm back in Ho Chi Minh City again, continuing my enthusiasm for science, especially science about microbes.

My current position is a Research Assistant at the Molecular Epidemiology Group at OUCRU Vietnam. In my work, I'm spending my time playing with bacterial genomic data, thinking and discussing about pathogenic microbes, paricularly their genetic profiles and their journeys in life.

My scientific interests are broad and dynamic, but over the past few years and probably more to come, I have just been sticking to the world of **microbes**, **ecology**, **evolution**, and **health**. I'm also specifically attracted to **complex systems** with inter-dependent relationships and emergent behaviours, such as host-microbiome systems. While studying these abstract concepts, I enjoy **coding**, learning and applying **tech**, analysing **data**, and **modelling**.
